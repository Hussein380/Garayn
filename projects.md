# Project Management & Admin Backend Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines a scalable, professional approach for managing and displaying projects in your application, including an admin backend for posting and managing projects, authentication, and frontend display with pagination.

---

## Goals
- **Admin Dashboard:** Secure login for admins to manage (create, update, delete) projects.
- **Project Posting:** Admins can post new projects with details, images, categories, etc.
- **Project Display:** Projects are shown on the public site, with pagination for performance and UX.
- **Scalability:** Easy to extend (e.g., add more fields, categories, or features like search/filter).
- **Security:** Only authenticated admins can manage projects.

---

## Recommended Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes (or a separate Node.js/Express server if needed)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (recommended), MySQL, or MongoDB (hosted on Vercel, Supabase, PlanetScale, or MongoDB Atlas)
- **ORM:** Prisma (for type-safe DB access)
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js (with credentials, Google, or other providers)
- **File/Image Uploads:** Upload to cloud storage (e.g., Cloudinary, S3, or Vercel Blob)
- **Frontend:** Next.js app directory, React, Tailwind CSS

---

## Architecture & Flow

### 1. **Database Schema (Projects Table)**
- `id` (UUID or auto-increment)
- `title`
- `description`
- `category`
- `tags` (array or string)
- `image` (URL)
- `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
- (Optional: `slug`, `client`, `year`, `gallery`, etc.)

### 2. **Authentication**
- Use NextAuth.js for admin login.
- Restrict admin routes/pages to authenticated users only.

### 3. **Admin Dashboard**
- Route: `/admin` (protected)
- Features:
  - Login/logout
  - List all projects (with pagination)
  - Create new project (form with image upload)
  - Edit/delete existing projects

### 4. **API Endpoints**
- `/api/projects` (GET: list with pagination, POST: create)
- `/api/projects/[id]` (GET: single, PUT: update, DELETE: remove)
- (All POST/PUT/DELETE endpoints require admin authentication)

### 5. **Frontend Display**
- Public route: `/projects` (shows paginated list)
- Project details: `/projects/[slug]`
- Pagination: Use query params (e.g., `/projects?page=2`)
- Optional: Search, filter, sort

### 6. **Image/File Uploads**
- Use a cloud service (Cloudinary, S3, or Vercel Blob) for project images.
- Store image URLs in the database.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Database & API**
1. Set up Prisma and your database (e.g., PostgreSQL on Supabase).
2. Define the `Project` model in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
3. Create API routes for CRUD operations with authentication checks.

### **Phase 2: Authentication**
1. Set up NextAuth.js for admin login.
2. Protect admin routes and API endpoints.

### **Phase 3: Admin Dashboard**
1. Build `/admin` pages for project management (list, create, edit, delete).
2. Add forms for project details and image uploads.

### **Phase 4: Public Project Display**
1. Build `/projects` page to fetch and display projects with pagination.
2. Build `/projects/[slug]` for project details.
3. Add pagination controls (e.g., next/prev, page numbers).

### **Phase 5: Enhancements (Optional)**
- Add search, filter, and sort to the projects list.
- Add project categories/tags.
- Add analytics for project views.

## Example Project Model (Prisma)
```prisma
model Project {
  id          String   @id @default(uuid())
  title       String
  description String
  category    String
  tags        String[]
  image       String
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
  // Add more fields as needed
}
```

---

## Security & Best Practices
- Never expose admin APIs to unauthenticated users.
- Validate and sanitize all inputs.
- Use environment variables for secrets (DB, auth, etc.).
- Regularly back up your database.

---

## Next Steps
- Choose your database provider (Supabase, PlanetScale, etc.).
- Set up Prisma and NextAuth.js.
- Scaffold the admin dashboard and API routes.
- Implement project CRUD and pagination.

**This architecture is scalable, secure, and easy to maintain. You can extend it with more features as your needs grow.**
